# Deep Learning Repository

## **Introduction to Deep Learning**
Deep Learning (DL) is a subset of **Machine Learning (ML)**, which itself is a subset of **Artificial Intelligence (AI)**. 

It involves training **artificial neural networks** with multiple layers (hence "deep") to learn patterns and representations from large and complex datasets. These models excel in handling **unstructured data** like images, audio, and text.

### **Hierarchy: AI ⊃ ML ⊃ DL**
> **AI** → Enables machines to mimic human intelligence and decision-making.
> **ML** → A subset of AI focused on algorithms that learn from data.
> **DL** → A subset of ML using deep neural networks for advanced pattern recognition.

## **Introduction to Machine Learning**
Machine Learning is a field of AI that enables computers to **learn from data without explicit programming**. It involves three major types of learning:

1. **Supervised Learning** – The model is trained on labeled data (e.g., spam vs. not spam).
2. **Unsupervised Learning** – The model discovers hidden patterns in unlabeled data (e.g., clustering customers by behavior).
3. **Reinforcement Learning** – The model learns by interacting with its environment and receiving feedback in the form of rewards or penalties.

Machine Learning is widely used in industries like healthcare, finance, e-commerce, and autonomous systems.

## **Brief History of Deep Learning**
Deep Learning has evolved over decades:

- **1943** – McCulloch and Pitts created the first computational model of a neuron.
- **1958** – Frank Rosenblatt introduced the **Perceptron**, a foundational neural network model.
- **1986** – Rumelhart, Hinton, and Williams popularized **backpropagation**, enabling deeper networks.
- **1998** – Yann LeCun introduced **LeNet**, an early convolutional neural network (CNN) for handwritten digit recognition.
- **2006** – Geoffrey Hinton revived deep learning with unsupervised pretraining methods.
- **2012** – AlexNet won the ImageNet competition, marking the modern deep learning revolution.
- **Today** – Deep Learning powers GPT models, AlphaFold, autonomous vehicles, and more.
